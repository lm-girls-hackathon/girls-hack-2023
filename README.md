# Girls Hack Starter Code

### Installation Instructions

To get the code on your computer, either use git or download a zip file. To use git:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lm-girls-hackathon/girls-hack-2023.git
$ cd girls-hack-2023
```

Once you have it installed, you must install arcade. Create and activate a virtual environment and then install the requirements.txt file. Make sure you are in the right directory while doing this!
```bash
$ python3 -m .venv/
$ source .venv/bin/activate # this command may vary based on your operating system. see https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html if your terminal is not bash or zsh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Alternatively, if you are using PyCharm, you can install arcade using its built-in package installer.

To run the game, you must run the `__main__.py` file. You can do this in your IDE, or from the terminal using the following command:
```bash
$ python3 .
```
